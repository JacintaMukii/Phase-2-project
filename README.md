# Predictive Modeling for Home Renovations: Enhancing Property Value through Data-Driven Insights




 ## Project Overview

 For this project, I have used  linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in
 northwestern county and provide insights on house prices so as to help stakeholders understand 
 the market dynamic and factors affecting housing values.

 ## Business Problem

 The business problem at hand revolves around predicting house prices based on various housing features in the kc housing dataset. This problem is of great significance to a wide range of stakeholders, including homeowners, sellers, real estate agencies, and property developers. My task is to develop a predictive model using the provided kc housing dataset to provide homeowners with valuable advice on how home renovations can potentially increase the estimated value of their properties and by what magnitude. The objective is to offer stakeholders insights into the key factors that impact house prices, such as location, size, condition, amenities, and the number of rooms, among others.

The creation of the predictive model will bring about several benefits, including:

1. Accurate pricing of assets: The model will enable stakeholders to accurately determine the value of their properties based on the identified housing features. This will facilitate fair and informed pricing strategies.

2. Informed investment decisions: The predictive model will assist stakeholders in making well-informed investment decisions related to real estate. By understanding the factors that influence house prices, stakeholders can allocate their resources effectively and identify investment opportunities with potential for higher returns.

3. Market trend insights: The predictive model will provide stakeholders with a deeper understanding of the prevailing market trends. By analyzing the relationships between housing features and prices, stakeholders can identify emerging patterns and adapt their strategies accordingly.

Overall, the development of the predictive model will empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize their investments, and stay ahead in the dynamic real estate market.

### Main objective

  The main objective is to offer homeowners expert guidance on leveraging home renovations to enhance the estimated value of their properties. This objective seeks to empower homeowners with valuable insights regarding the potential increase in value resulting from specific renovation projects. By providing comprehensive advice, the goal is to enable homeowners to make well- informed decisions about their home renovations, effectively allocate their resources, and potentially maximize their return on investment when selling their homes.

### Specific objectives

   - Develop a simple linear regression model to assess the relationship between the grade/reviews of renovated houses and their      
     prices, determining whether higher grades/reviews are associated with higher prices.

   - Build a multiple linear regression model to investigate the relationship between the top 5  renovation features in the            
     housing dataset (such as location, size, condition, amenities, and number of rooms) and housing prices, aiming to           
     
     understand how these features collectively influence the prices.

   - Evaluate the performance of a comprehensive regression model that analyzes the relationship between all available          
     
     renovation features in the housing dataset and  housing prices, with the goal of accurately predicting prices based on 
     
     these features. 

### Experimental Design

   - **Data Collection** - This involves loading and inspecting the King County House Sales dataset in northwestern county.The dataset contains both categorical and numerical data.
    
   - **Data Preprocessing** - In this section, I have done the following  : Dropping columns from the dataset, checking and removing duplicates in the dataset, detecting and dealing with null values in the dataset, separating values from words in a column.
     
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis** - I have summarized and analyzed datasets to gain insights, identify patterns and understand the  underlying structire of the data using univariate, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis.
     
   - **Feature selection** - I performed multicollinearity between variables and splitting of data.   
    
   - **Data modelling and model performance evaluation** - Modelling and evaluating the performance of  linear regressions models.
    
   - **Model interpretation** -I have checked the best performing model using two metrics: r squared and mean squared  error (mse).
      
   - **Conclusions and Recommendations** - based on the model interpretation. 


   **Conclusion**

- Stockholders should leverage multiple housing renovation features to positively impact housing prices. By incorporating a variety of desirable renovation elements, such as high-quality materials, modern design elements, energy-efficient upgrades, and functional layouts, stakeholders can enhance the perceived value of properties and potentially command higher housing prices. It is important to consider a comprehensive approach to renovations, taking into account the preferences and demands of potential buyers or renters, market trends, and the overall quality and attractiveness of the renovated properties.   

**Recommendations**

- I would recommend that stakeholders consider incorporating many housing features that have a significant impact on  renovations. These features may include renovation grade/reviews, renovation floors, and other relevant factors. By considering these aspects, stakeholders can gain a comprehensive understanding of the renovation landscape and make informed decisions about the most effective strategies for enhancing the value of their properties.
  
- Conducting surveys to capture clients' preferences regarding renovations related to the business problem can provide valuable insights. By actively seeking feedback from potential buyers or renters, stakeholders can better understand their specific renovation preferences, priorities, and expectations.
